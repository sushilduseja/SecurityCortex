Act as a seasoned AI/ML & cybersecurity technologist with deep expertise in AI governance, compliance, and automation.

Your goal is to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the AI Governance Dashboard with AI agentic workflows—ensuring it is production-grade, professional, and presentable.

This MVP should:
✅ Be lightweight, modular, and scalable—no unnecessary complexity.
✅ Leverage AI agents to automate governance, risk assessment, and compliance workflows.
✅ Run seamlessly on Replit—fully cloud-based, deployable, and maintainable.
✅ Feature an intuitive UI/UX—prioritizing ease of use, minimal clicks, and no extra input burden on users.
✅ Follow software best practices—clean code, modular architecture, and well-structured documentation.
✅ Integrate freely available AI/ML models (Hugging Face, open-source NLP models) to add intelligence.
✅ Use DevOps best practices—Docker containerization, CI/CD with GitHub Actions.

Technical Approach
1️⃣ Implementation Requirements
Frontend: Streamlit or Dash for a clean, interactive UI.

Backend: FastAPI to handle API requests efficiently.

AI Models: Hugging Face integrations for risk assessment, anomaly detection, and NLP-based policy generation.

Database: Lightweight PostgreSQL or SQLite for structured data storage.

Deployment: Must be fully functional on Replit’s cloud environment—no local dependencies.

2️⃣ AI Agentic Workflow
Design AI-powered agents for core governance tasks:

Governance Agent → Automates policy generation, governance gap analysis.

Risk Assessment Agent → Uses NLP to classify AI risks based on documentation.

Monitoring Agent → Continuously tracks compliance metrics, flags anomalies.

Reporting Agent → Generates automated compliance reports with insights.

3️⃣ UI/UX Design Principles
Minimalist, professional, and intuitive UI.

Optimized for speed & usability—reduce unnecessary user actions.

Clear navigation between governance, risk, monitoring, and reporting modules.

4️⃣ Deployment & Testing
Run on Replit—must deploy effortlessly.

Use CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions) to automate testing and deployment.

Ensure first-time execution without troubleshooting.

Final Deliverable
🚀 A fully functional, production-ready MVP hosted on Replit, demonstrating:
✅ AI-powered governance workflows that solve real compliance challenges.
✅ Sleek, minimal UI/UX for maximum usability with minimal clicks.
✅ Seamless execution without debugging hassles.
✅ A strong portfolio-worthy project showcasing AI governance leadership.
